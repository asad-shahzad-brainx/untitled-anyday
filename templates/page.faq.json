            "text": "<p>When it comes to convenience, the microwave is king. With the right equipment and settings, microwaving food doesn’t mean sacrificing taste, either. Microwave cooking can be a more efficient, just-as-tasty alternative to water-based cooking such as steaming, poaching, quick braising, boiling, or stewing. It’s also a great complement to other methods, allowing you to cut down on cooking time before finishing a dish in the oven or on the stove. Since Anyday’s recipes typically only require one dish, cleanup is easier.</p><p>A little-known fact: microwave cooking is better for you! Food loses nutrients the longer and hotter it’s cooked, so by quickly heating food, microwaving preserves more nutrients than methods like boiling or baking.

According to Harvard Health, “the cooking method that best retains nutrients is one that cooks quickly, heats food for the shortest amount of time, and uses as little liquid as possible.” Microwave cooking checks all of those boxes.

            "text": "<p>All microwaves have their sweet spots when it comes to cooking time. That's because they come in all different wattages, which translates to how powerful your microwave is. Microwave wattages typically range from 700 to 1200 watts (w). The higher the wattage, the faster your food will cook. The lower the wattage, the longer the cook time.</p><p>To find your microwave's wattage, take a look at the front panel, the side of the door, in the back, or in the user manual. You can also look up the microwave model number online to find wattage. If you see both an input and output wattage listed, use the output.</p><p>Once you know your microwave wattage, our recipe and ingredient guide cook times can be customized to suit it. If your wattage isn't listed, choose the closest higher wattage.</p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://cookanyday.com/blogs/news/how-to-cook-good-food-in-the-microwave\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> for more information.</p>",

The default power level for every microwave is full power (also called Power Level 10, or 100%, or High), but cooking everything at this level is like always using high heat or broil on your stove or oven. There are times when you just need more finesse, whether you're steaming rice at a gentle simmer, poaching fish, or making cheesecake. We list suggested cooking levels in each Anyday recipe.</p><p>Different microwaves have different settings. See your microwave manual (or look it up online) to learn how to change your microwave’s power level. For many microwaves: enter the cook time, press the “Power” (or “Power Level”) button, and select a number between 1-10. Other microwaves may require selecting the Power Level first, and then entering the cook time.</p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://cookanyday.com/blogs/news/how-to-cook-good-food-in-the-microwave\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> for more information.</p>",

First, our glass lid is thick and sturdy, which both helps the steam stay in better, which is essential when you're cooking in the microwave, and traps heat as well so it cooks more evenly. By contrast, a plastic lid will warp quickly — it's ok for reheating, but it's not sturdy or long-lasting enough for cooking.</p><p>Second, our lid also has vents in the knob that allow just the right amount of steam to escape so that pressure doesn't build up. There's a safety feature in our lid that makes sure it never blows off dangerously. Plastic lids will seal too tightly and can explode off, so you'll have a lot of microwave splatters to clean up!</p><p>Third, plastic in the microwave is a no-go for us — according to <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-plastic-a-threat-to-your-health\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard</a>, it's the <em>one</em> thing about microwaves that actually isn't safe!</p>",

Because of the smaller dish size, the lid knob can also be smaller and more stackable, which is great for cabinet storage. The knob works exactly the same way as our original dishes: pull up to cook/reheat and push down to store! It also doesn’t need the metal since folks won’t be doing much heavy-duty cooking in them.</p>",
